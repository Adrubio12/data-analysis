# data-analysis
Code corresponding to the final project of the Data Analysis subject. This work was jointly developed with all the members of the group

The project consisted on analysing several gigabytes of data corresponding to different restaurants and venues from across USA and Canada, obtained from a social media where 
restaurants and clients have profiles, and clients can write a review for a given restaurant.

user_data.csv contains all the data related to the users

business_data.csv contains all the data related to the businesses and venues

review_data.csv contains all data related to the reviews

We chose to focus on the Toronto area since it was the area with the most amount of businesses and users


This repository contais all the source files developed to process the data and to obtain the results. The process and reasoning is detailed in the pdf
